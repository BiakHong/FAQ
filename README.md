## Technical Overview

### Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core:** The web application is built on the ASP.NET Core framework, providing a robust and cross-platform foundation.

- **Entity Framework Core:** The application utilizes Entity Framework Core as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for database interactions. It simplifies data access and provides database migrations.

- **Razor Views:** Views are created using Razor syntax, allowing a seamless integration of C# code within HTML, making it easier to build dynamic and data-driven web pages.

- **MVC Architecture:** The project follows the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern. Models represent the data entities, Views handle the presentation logic, and Controllers manage the user input and application flow.

- **Dependency Injection:** ASP.NET Core's built-in Dependency Injection is leveraged for managing and injecting dependencies, promoting modular and testable code.

- **Routing:** The application uses attribute-based routing in the `HomeController` to handle different URL patterns, allowing users to navigate through topics and categories.

- **Database Seeding:** Initial data for FAQs, categories, and topics is seeded into the database during application startup, ensuring a consistent and populated dataset for demonstration.
